This is a PowerShell script designed to automate bulk USB drive creation. It formats the removable drives attached to the system
with the disk label specified, and then copies the contents of a designated folder to the root of the USB drive. 
Parellel file copy allows for a large speed improvement compared to some other solutions that perform a sequential copy.

Be careful, this script will format ALL removable devices attached to the system.
